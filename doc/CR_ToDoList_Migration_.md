# Change Request (CR): Todo List Application Migration

## CR-001: C++ Qt to Go Fyne Migration with English Localization

### Request Overview

**Request ID:** CR-001
**Title:** Migrate Qt C++ Todo List Application to Go with Fyne GUI Framework
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Approved for Development
**Submitted Date:** October 2, 2025
**Target Completion:** TBD (Estimated 4-6 weeks)

---

## 1. Purpose and Rationale

### 1.1 Business Need
The existing C++ Qt-based Todo List application provides comprehensive task management functionality but faces several limitations:

- **Platform Dependency**: Limited to Qt-supported platforms, restricting cross-platform deployment
- **Language Barrier**: Chinese UI elements limit accessibility for English-speaking users
- **Maintenance Complexity**: C++ Qt development requires specialized expertise
- **Distribution Challenges**: Qt applications require framework installation on target systems

### 1.2 Migration Objectives
**Primary Goals:**
- Achieve **zero functionality loss** - maintain identical behavior to original application
- Enable **cross-platform deployment** (Windows, macOS, Linux) via single binary
- **Localize UI to English** for broader market accessibility
- **Improve maintainability** through Go's simplicity and modern development practices

**Secondary Goals:**
- Reduce deployment complexity (single executable, no external dependencies)
- Leverage modern GUI framework (Fyne) for consistent cross-platform experience
- Maintain existing file-based persistence system for data compatibility

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- **Functional Equivalence**: All original features work identically in new implementation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Successful builds and execution on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Data Integrity**: Existing data files load correctly in new application
- **User Experience**: Smooth animations and interactions preserved from original
- **Language Localization**: All UI text professionally translated to English

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Original Application Features
Based on comprehensive analysis of the provided C++ Qt source code:

**Core Functionality:**
- **Todo Management**: Create, edit, delete, and mark complete todo items
- **Rich Properties**: Name, content, location, labels, priority levels, due dates/times, reminder settings
- **Visual Organization**: Timeline-based layout with date grouping and smooth scrolling
- **Priority System**: 4-level priority system with color-coded visual indicators
- **View Modes**: All items, incomplete only, and reminder-based filtering
- **Data Persistence**: File-based storage organized by month (data/YYYYMM.txt format)

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Language**: C++ with Qt GUI framework
- **UI States**: LIST (view), EDIT (create), DETAIL (modify) modes
- **Animation System**: Smooth scrolling and transition effects
- **File I/O**: Custom text serialization format with multi-line string support

### 2.2 Current Limitations
- **Platform Restrictions**: Qt framework dependencies limit deployment options
- **Language Limitation**: Chinese UI restricts English-speaking user base
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Complex C++ Qt codebase requires specialized skills
- **Distribution Complexity**: Requires Qt runtime installation on target systems

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1 Migration Strategy
**Technology Migration:**
- **From**: C++ + Qt GUI framework
- **To**: Go programming language + Fyne GUI toolkit
- **Architecture**: Maintain identical feature set and user interaction patterns

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Data Structure Recreation**: Implement identical TodoItem structure in Go
2. **Business Logic Port**: Migrate PA (Personal Assistant) class functionality
3. **UI Recreation**: Build Fyne-based interface matching original layout and behavior
4. **File I/O Compatibility**: Preserve exact file format for data persistence
5. **Animation Recreation**: Implement smooth scrolling and transitions using Fyne animation APIs

### 3.2 Language Translation Requirements

#### Chinese → English UI Translation Mapping

**Window and Navigation Elements:**
- "我的一天" (Window Title) → "My Day"
- "<" (Previous Month) → "<"
- ">" (Next Month) → ">"
- "全部" (All) → "All"
- "未完成" (Incomplete) → "Incomplete"
- "提醒" (Reminders) → "Reminders"

**Form Elements:**
- "请输入待办事项" (Name Placeholder) → "Enter todo item"
- "地点：" (Location Label) → "Location:"
- "标签：" (Label Placeholder) → "Label:"
- "内容：" (Content Placeholder) → "Content:"
- "事件" (Event) → "Event"
- "任务" (Task) → "Task"

**Priority Levels:**
- "很重要-很紧急" → "Important - Urgent"
- "不重要-很紧急" → "Not Important - Urgent"
- "很重要-不紧急" → "Important - Not Urgent"
- "不重要-不紧急" → "Not Important - Not Urgent"

**Action Buttons:**
- "添加" (Add) → "Add"
- "修改" (Edit) → "Edit"
- "+" (Add Button) → "+"
- "x" (Cancel/Close) → "x"

**Status Messages:**
- "不提醒" (No Reminder) → "No reminder"
- "提前X天X小时X分提示" → "Remind X days X hours X minutes before"

### 3.3 Technical Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up Go project structure with Fyne dependencies
- Implement core data structures (TodoItem, Date equivalents)
- Create file I/O utilities matching original format exactly
- Build basic application shell with window management

#### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 3-4)
- Implement todo item management (CRUD operations)
- Build data persistence layer with monthly file organization
- Create priority system with color coding
- Develop view mode filtering (All, Incomplete, Reminders)

#### Phase 3: UI Polish (Week 5-6)
- Implement timeline-based layout with date grouping
- Add smooth scrolling and animation effects
- Polish form layouts and input validation
- Complete English localization and visual styling

#### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Week 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing against original application
- Cross-platform validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Data migration testing with existing files
- Performance optimization and final polish
